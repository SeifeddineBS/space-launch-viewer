# Space Launch Viewer

This project is an Angular application designed to display a list of space launches. It uses Apollo Client to interact with a GraphQL API to retrieve launch data.

## Features

- **Launch List**: Displays a list of space launches with details fetched from a GraphQL API.
- **Search Filter**: Allows users to filter launches by search text (not fully implemented in the code yet).
- **Loading State**: Shows a loading indicator while data is being fetched.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if the data retrieval fails.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: A popular web application framework.
- **Apollo Client**: A GraphQL client used to query and manage application data.
- **GraphQL**: API technology used to retrieve data about space launches.
- **ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush**: Optimizes the performance by minimizing unnecessary change detection cycles in Angular.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SeifeddineBS/space-launch-viewer.git
   cd space-launch-viewer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the app:**

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

   The app should now be running at `http://localhost:4200/`.

## GraphQL API

The app retrieves space launch data through a GraphQL API. Ensure you have the correct API endpoint set up in your `graphql.queries.ts` file.

Example of a GraphQL query for fetching launches:

```typescript

   id
    mission_name
    links {
      flickr_images
      mission_patch_small
    }
    rocket {
      rocket_name
    }
    launch_date_utc
export const launches = gql`
  query GetLaunches {
    launches {
        id
        mission_name
        links {
            flickr_images
            mission_patch_small
        }
        rocket {
            rocket_name
        }
        launch_date_utc
  }
`;
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Search Functionality**: Implement search/filter logic to allow users to search launches by text (e.g., mission name).
- **Launch Details**: Display more detailed information for each launch.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination or lazy loading to handle large datasets efficiently.
